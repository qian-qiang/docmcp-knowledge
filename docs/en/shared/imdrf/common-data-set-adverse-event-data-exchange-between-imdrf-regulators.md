# Introduction 

This document has been prepared by the IMDRF Adverse Event Terminology Working Group (AET WG), charged with developing a harmonized terminology for reporting adverse events related to medical devices including in-vitro diagnostics (IVDs).

Since GHTF SG2/N54 (Medical Devices Post Market Surveillance: Global Guidance for Adverse Event Reporting for Medical Devices) was published in 2006, most GHTF members implemented adverse event reporting systems aligning with the general principles of N54. Building on the work of N54, the IMDRF AET WG developed globally harmonized terminology and codes for product problem, cause investigation, health effects, and components (IMDRF/N43). Widespread use of a single, appropriate adverse event terminology and coding system is expected to improve signal detection and validation by adverse event management systems enabling a faster response by both industry and regulatory authorities for public health safety. 

As both regulators and industry work towards implementation of IMDRF terminology, an important next step is establishing a “Common Data Set” (CDS) for global adverse event report information exchange, so that all stakeholders can utilize the full potential of the IMDRF Terminology for signal detection and trend analysis (similar to the ICH E2B standard in pharmacovigilance). Therefore, following the completion of all IMDRF Terminology (IMDRF/N43: Edition 4 2020) and outlining the process for future maintenance, (IMDRF/N44: Edition 3 2020), the group has started the process toward a CDS by reviewing the current adverse event reporting datasets collected by representative IMDRF member jurisdictions to develop a common data set for data exchange as well as guidelines for the exchange of adverse event data between regulators. This CDS will then be used to by regulators to exchange data for signal detection, with the aim of expanding it to the final goal of a harmonised CDS for global adverse event reporting. 

This document is not defining how to detect and validate signals or how the jurisdictions should manage them. This document only applies to the actual exchange of adverse event data, based on the common data set.

# Scope 

This document is intended to provide guidance on the CDS:

  * Defining the draft CDS fields and format 
  * Reasons for sharing.

# Common Data Set (CDS) 

The common data set is mostly compromised of a subset of the Universal Data Set from GHTF N54 published 15 years ago, but it also adds some additional elements which were widely collected by IMDRF members in their present reporting templates. 

There were numerous fields which the WG believed could possibly be harmonized in the future, but at present, the WG defined the minimum data set for exchange for signal detection whilst maintaining data protection.

The CDS will be updated and reviewed in the future based on learning from the exchange of data. 

The elements of the CDS at this time are defined at a high level, to allow each regulator to map their individual fields into the CDS. Formats for each field include string (alpha-numeric free text), date, picklist, and numeric. The picklist of the current CDS is understood to be a combination of each regulator’s picklist, to be further examined and harmonized in the future. 

Key points to note:

  * Not all IMDRF jurisdictions may gather all information included in the CDS, in which case only the available fields should be shared.
  * Only the most recent version of the report should be shared.
  * Data should be input into this CDS “as is” with only minimum (if any) complex re-mapping or extraction/conversion of data to “fit” the CDS- as the focus is on sharing the data. 
  * Clinical Trial/Premarket will not be exchanged.
  * Non industry reports will not be exchanged.

While the adverse event reporting system used for drugs employs a standard reporting format (Individual Case Safety Reports based on the ICH E2B standard) and global database (VigiBase, maintained by the WHO), the scope of this current common dataset is limited to data exchange between regulators. This includes details of what data should be considered for exchange as well as details of how the data can be exchanged. This document does not prescribe or suggest when a Regulator my consider the exchange data. It is up to the Regulator in individual jurisdictions to determine when they will share their data. 

This exchange differs from the NCAR exchange as this is the sharing of the actual adverse event data. This data exchange could lead to an NCAR being sent or could occur as follow-up to an NCAR.

(See Appendix A for detail of elements in the CDS.)

# Reasons for Data Sharing 

There are multiple reasons why data might need to be shared/exchanged. The following are examples of why jurisdiction may decide to exchange data.

  * Sharing on demand when one jurisdiction has a need/request.
  * Identifying whether a trend is a local or global trend.
  * Global signal analysis/identification.
  * Development and testing of analytical algorithms.
  * Learning for data collection harmonization for effective signal identification.

Data sharing/exchange may be between two jurisdictions or across multiple jurisdictions. It is expected that any jurisdiction that requests data will share any findings from their review back to the jurisdiction providing the data.

# The Exchange of Information

**How to request information**

When requesting information from another jurisdiction it is essential that the request is very clear so that the recipient can easily understand the incident reports that need to be included in the data set that is shared. 

The CDS form must be used. The form consists of two sections:

  1. A data request section that is completed by the requestor and provided to those NCAs from whom data is requested. 
  2. A data response section that is completed by the responder and should be included with the data in the response.

The form template can be found in Appendix C.

The detail below outlines how each section of the form should be completed by the requestor and the responder. 

  1. **Details to be completed by the Requestor.**

**Title of the Request**

The requestor should include a short name for the request that the responder can use in the filename of the response that is provided.

**Request Details**

This section of the form should detail who the request is from.

It should also detail when the request is being made and the expected/requested date for a reply.

**Specific Detail of the Request**

This section should detail the information that is being sought. A detailed description of what is being sought should be provided followed by guidance on how the data should be searched using the IMDRF codes.

An outline of the priority or most important codes of interest, or in which sequence the codes should be searched e.g. the search should be conducted using Annex A codes first then Annex E and then Annex G. A listing of all cases with Annex A codes should be provided with those case that include Annex A and Annex E and/or G highlighted.   
Relevant documents or links to relevant documents can be provided. 

Where the request requires an unusual / different timeframe of interest this should be specified, and rationale provided e.g. implantable devices may require a different time period.

As the requester of information, you may need to filter the data you receive.

This is to minimise the burden on the jurisdiction sharing the data, and to maximise the data shared, as some fields may not be collected by some jurisdictions or be provided by adverse event reporters. 

**Scope of the Request**

Select the appropriate sentence that best describes the “Type of request” and “the focus of the request”.

**Specific Search Criteria**

Date Period 

By default, the date period refers to the “initial date of receipt” field detailed in the CDS. 

If the search requires a different date (e.g. awareness date), please provide details in the “Specific Detail of the Request”.

Specific Device Details

Where applicable for the request use the options listed to identify the device of interest.

If the request is not specific to a device the field can be left blank.

Manufacturer Details

Please provide details of the Manufacturer’s name/manufacturers’ names. 

If the request is not specific to a manufacturer the field can be left blank.

**IMDRF Codes of Interest**

In this section, please detail the IMDRF codes of interest.

Where you wish to have a particular focus on specific codes, please detail your requirements in the “Specific Detail of the Request”.

Care should be given to the level of codes (parent or child) requested, as not all jurisdictions use all levels. By default, if you request a parent term the response should include all the associated child terms.

  1. **Details to be completed by the Responder.**

**Responder Details**

This section of the form should provide details of the organisation that is responding to the request, including the responder’s name and email address.

**Specific details of how the data was generated.**

This section should detail how your organisation has generated the data provided. 

Details of the specific search criteria used should be included.

Where you may have deviated from the original request. E.g. Date field, codes level, this should be highlighted and explained.

Where delayed reporting by the manufacturer may impact the number of reports this should be highlighted.

**Additional Comments**

Additional information can be included in this section to assist the requestor in the interpretation of the data you provided or any observation that you have noted when collating the data that you think may assist the requestor. 

# Format for Sharing Common Data Set 

General guidelines on the sharing of data include (See Appendix A for field level formats)

  * Use spreadsheet file with the defined column headers detailed in Appendix A 
  * One line for one report for one device (Incidents reported with multiple devices involved must be split into multiple lines)
  * In case a single cell contains multiple values, e.g. IMDRF adverse events codes of a single annex, these need to be separated by a semi colon, without any padding spaces.
  * In case the jurisdiction does not collect a specific field the exact string ‘ _Not collected’_ is to be used. 
  * Where no data is provided but the specific field is collected by the jurisdiction the convention is to include the field but to leave it blank.
  * The spreadsheet should be named following the guidance in Appendix A, including the “request title**”** provided in the request form.

Note: The format may be subject to change in the future to facilitate data quality checks, e.g., by sharing via XML format accompanied with a XSD to validate the data, or to allow directly for advanced queries by exchange via database formats such as SQLite.

# How to Exchange Information

It is recommended that the Common Data set should be shared via secure email. 

The IMDRF Adverse Event Terminology Working Group will establish and maintain a list of a contact points for the purpose of the exchange of Common Data Set. A copy of the latest version of the contact point listing will be made available to all jurisdictions and entities associated with the IMDRF. 

When circulating a CDS or requesting data from another jurisdiction the cover email should detail the reason why the data is being sought or provided and the confidentiality arrangement that is supporting the exchange or the request (see section 9.0 below). 

The email should also detail a recommended deadline for the response to the requested information. 

In some instances, where the content of a CDS supports or supplements the content of an NCAR that is being exchange under section 4.1 **Exchange criteria** of the Medical Devices: Post-Market Surveillance: National Competent Authority Report Exchange Criteria and Report Form IMDRF/NCAR WG/N14FINAL:2023 (Edition 4), the CDS could be added as an appendix to the NCAR. 

# Confidentiality Of Data 

Adverse event reports may contain confidential information. Different jurisdictions consider different information confidential. When sharing reports, all parties must take all precautions to keep data secure. 

  * Jurisdictions should only share data with other jurisdictions with whom they have confidentiality arrangements – either through Memoradum of Understanding (MOU) or Data Sharing Agreements (DSA). In either case, the exchange of incident level data should be allowed in the agreements.
  * Jurisdictions must satisfy themsleves that the incident level data they hold may be shared with other jurisdictions e.g that the originator of the data has consented (some jurisdictions have overarching regulations/laws that allow this)
  * Any aggregation/reporting/analsyis on the data should carefully follow the agreements in place between jurisdictions. Data received from a jurisdiction may not be shared with another jurisdiction however it may be possible to share aggregate analysis results with other jurisdiction if no individual data is shared.
  * None of the information shared may be released without the explicit authorization of the authoring NCA.
  * Each jurisdiction should determine the appropriate measures to assure secure exchange and storage of data in accordance with the agreements that are in place between parties
  * Data should be destroyed when it is no longer needed.
  * No data which can identify individual patient(s) can be shared among jurisdictions.

# File information

## File type

In order to share data efficiently and in a file format that is easily read and written, the IMDRF CDS currently uses spreadsheet format to communicate internally. 

## Naming convention

Every request should have a short title on the request form; the format of the filename should include this title. Filenames should be in the format YYYY-MM-DD_&lt;3166-1 alpha-2 countrycode&gt;_&lt;short title&gt;.xlsx, with the date being the date of the request (to distinguish between repeated requests with the same title), and the short title should be devoid of special characters that are not permitted in file names. 

e.g., if a request form is titled “Needle-stick injuries with Company_name needles” with a request date of October 2, 2024, a response file sent from Japan’s PMDA could be titled 2024-10-02_JP_ Needle-stick injuries with Company_name needles.xlsx

## Headers

The sample file lists the headers and has the appropriate data types selected; if setting up an excel file from a blank form the following are recommended. 

Cell A1 can have the simple title of the response file. Common Data Set for Adverse Event Data Exchange between IMDRF Regulators 

The headers for each column should reflect the names of the columns from the common data set, which are currently the following: the full field names are listed, but the spreadsheet uses names without spaces to ensure compatibility with databases and programming languages, as indicated
