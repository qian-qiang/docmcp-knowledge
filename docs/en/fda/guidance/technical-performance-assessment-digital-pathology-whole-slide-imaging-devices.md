Technical Performance Assessment of Digital Pathology Whole Slide Imaging Devices

This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic.  It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public.  You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.  To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.
14
## I. Introduction 16
FDA is issuing this guidance to provide industry and agency staff with recommendations regarding the technical performance assessment data that should be provided for regulatory evaluation of a digital whole slide imaging (WSI) system.  This document does not cover the clinical submission data that may be necessary to support approval or clearance.  This document provides our suggestions on how to best characterize the technical aspects that are relevant to WSI performance for their intended use and determine any possible limitations that might affect their safety and effectiveness.
24
Recent technological advances in digital microscopy, in particular the development of whole slide scanning systems, have accelerated the adoption of digital imaging in pathology, similar to the digital transformation that radiology departments have experienced over the last decade.  FDA regulates WSI system manufacturers to help ensure that the images intended for clinical uses are reasonably safe and effective for such purposes.  Essential to the regulation of these systems is the understanding of the technical performance of the WSI system and the components in the imaging chain, from image acquisition to image display and their effect on pathologist’s diagnostic performance and workflow.  Prior to performing non-technical analytical studies (i.e., those using clinical samples) and clinical studies to evaluate a digital imaging system’s performance, the manufacturer should first determine the technical characteristics that are relevant to such performance for its intended use and determine any possible limitations that might affect its safety and effectiveness.  This guidance provides recommendations 37 for the assessment of technical characteristics of a WSI device.
39
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.  Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.  The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.
45
## II. Background 47
For over a hundred years, the reference method for the diagnosis of cancer and many other critical clinical conditions has been histopathological examination of tissues using conventional light microscopy.  This process is known as surgical pathology in the United States.
52
In surgical pathology, patient tissue from surgery, biopsy or autopsy goes through a process that includes dissection, fixation, embedding, and cutting of tissue into very thin slices which are then stained, for example by the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) protocol, and permanently mounted onto glass slides.  The slides are examined by a pathologist under a light microscope by dynamically adjusting the focus and using different magnifications.  By integrating their interpretations obtained by microscopic examination of the tissue from all slides pertaining to a case, pathologists arrive at a diagnosis of the case.
61
WSI refers to the digitization of the stained entire tissue specimen on a glass slide.  The glass slide is still prepared and stained just as for conventional light microscopy.
Depending on the system used, various magnifications, scanning methodologies, hardware, and software are employed to convert the optical image of the slide into a digital whole slide image.  With WSI, the pathologist views the image on a computer monitor rather than through the microscope oculars.
68
## III. Scope 70
This document provides guidance regarding only the technical performance assessment of WSI systems for regulatory evaluation.  WSI systems are defined here as those consisting of (a) an image acquisition subsystem that converts the content of a glass slide into a digital image file, and (b) a workstation environment for viewing the digital images.  If not otherwise specified, the term “image” in the context of whole slide imaging refers to a pyramid structure consisting of multiple images at different resolutions. The baseline image has the highest resolution.  This guidance is applicable for surgical pathology tasks performed in the anatomic pathology laboratory.  It is intended to provide recommendations to industry and FDA staff regarding only the technical performance assessment data needed for the regulatory evaluation of a WSI device.  This document is not meant to provide guidance for special stain techniques or fluorescence imaging or for the non-technical analytical studies (utilizing clinical 82 samples) or pivotal clinical studies necessary to support safety and effectiveness, nor does this guidance alone suffice to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of WSI systems.
Interpretation of WSI images on mobile platforms is beyond the scope of this guidance.
86
## IV. Policy 88
The following subsections of this section describe the technical performance assessment data FDA believes will facilitate the regulatory evaluation of a WSI device.
91
IV(A). Description and Test Methods for Each Component 93
This subsection details the descriptions and the test methods at the component level that should be included in the technical performance assessment of a WSI device.  For purposes of this guidance only, a component is a piece of hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software that processes the image signals flowing through the imaging chain.  The concept of a component is based on the transformation of the image signals.  For example, the digital imaging sensor is a hardware device that converts optical signals into digital signals.  The image composition component is a software program that stitches sub-images together to form a whole slide image.  A component and a physical device need not be in close physical proximity.  For example, the light source component and the image optics component are usually tightly coupled within the same device, while the display calibration data is often distributed in both the color profile in the computer environment component and the on-screen display settings in the display component.
107
The components in a WSI device can be grouped in two subsystems: image acquisition and image display.  The image acquisition subsystem digitizes the tissue slide as a digital image file.  The image display subsystem converts the digital image file into optical signals for the human reader.  In the paradigm of telemedicine, the digital image file can be electronically sent to a remote site for reading, so the image acquisition subsystem and the image display subsystem do not need to be physically coupled.  Methods for independently testing the image acquisition and display subsystems are described in Section IV(B).
116
Sponsors should provide a block diagram of the components found in the WSI system in the premarket submission.  A chart indicating the relationship among the components and the test methods utilized for the specific system characterization should also be provided.
Diagram 1 on the following page is offered as an example block diagram of typical components found in current WSI systems.  The components of a particular WSI system might not include all of those listed in the diagram or may include additional components.  Sponsors are encouraged to provide additional diagrams, illustrations, and photographs of their devices as part of their submissions.

374
IV(A)(7).
Image Composition 376
IV(A)(7)(a).
Description 378
Image composition is a step present in systems that produce whole slide images as opposed to individual fields of view.  Whole slide scanning is typically performed in accordance with the positioning of a stage that moves in submicron steps.  At each location of the stage movement, an image of the field of view is acquired.  Images can be acquired with a degree of overlapping (redundancy) between them to avoid gaps in data collection.  Images can also be acquired at different depths of focus followed by the application of focusing algorithms.  At the end of this process, all acquired images are combined (stitched) together to create a composite high resolution image.  There are a number of features that can affect this process, and they are listed below.  Sponsors should provide a description of these features, if applicable: · Scanning method o Single objective or multiple miniature objectives in an array pattern o Scanning pattern: square matrix acquisition (tiling), line scanning, etc.
o Overlap between scanned regions o Merging algorithms that stitch the aligned images together into a composite image file.  Such algorithms may employ functions to align adjacent fields of view in accordance to the scanning pattern, overlap, etc.
o Automatic background correction functions to eliminate the effect of non-
396
uniformities in the microscope’s illumination and image merging procedure.  These non-uniformities if not corrected might create visible borders (seams and stitch lines) between the adjacent fields of view.
- Scanning speed:  time to scan the whole slide.  This time is dependent on selected magnification, and the amount of tissue on the glass slide.

Description 415
416
The final result from image acquisition can be a whole slide image consisting of a stack 417 of all acquired fields of view and magnifications during WSI.  The complete digitized 418 image file usually occupies between 1-20 gigabytes of storage space depending on the 419 sample and the magnification of the objective lens used.  Images can then be stored in a 420 number of ways and formats.  Sponsors should provide the following information: 421

IV(B). System-level Assessment 590
591
This subsection details the test methods at the system level that should be included in the 592 technical performance assessment of a WSI device.  In this guidance, system refers to a 593 series of consecutive components in the imaging chain with clearly defined, measureable 594 input and output.  For example, a system-level test can be designed for the image 595 acquisition subsystem, the image display subsystem, or a combination of both.  The goal 596 of system-level tests is to assess the composite performance of a series of consecutive 597 components in the imaging chain.  System-level tests should be conducted when the 598 component-level tests are either unfeasible or unable to capture the interplay between 599 components.
600
601
The common framework of the system-level tests described in this section is to compare 602 the system under test with an ideal system based on the same input, and then report the 603 difference between their outputs quantitatively.  Designing such a system-level test 604 typically involves the following steps: (1) define the scope of the system and its input and 605 output, (2) define the input, which in most cases is a test target or phantom, (3) measure 606 the input to establish the ground truth that would be generated by an ideal system, (4)
607
measure the output of the system under test, and (5) calculate the errors between the truth 608 and the output with a quantitative metric.  The framework of a typical system-level test is 609 shown in Diagram 2.  Notice that the ideal system is a hypothetical device that generates 610 the perfect output with respect to the objective of the test such as color or focus.  The 611 purpose of the ideal system is to define the intended behavior of the system under test.
612
The ideal system does not need to be implemented.  Instead, the ideal system should be 613 simulated by a test method that establishes the truth of the input phantom.

629
Color reproducibility is one of the key characteristics of a WSI system. The color 630 characteristics are determined by every component in the imaging chain. Therefore, the 631 color characteristics might be best evaluated at the system level. Color reproducibility 632 indicates the accuracy and precision of the color transformation from the tissue sample on 633 the slide to the image on the display. The colors of the tissue specimen should be 634 accurately and precisely reproduced on the display based on the color reproduction intent, 635 which should be clearly defined and justified by the sponsor.
636
637
IV(B)(1)(b).
Test Methods 638
639
The WSI system should be tested with a target slide. The target slide should contain a set 640 of measurable and representative color patches. Ideally the color patches should have 641 similar spectral characteristics to stained tissue. The color patches should include a 642 grayscale ramp for evaluating the grayscale response. The truth of the color patches 643 should be measured with proper apparatuses separately.
644
645
For each color patch, the intended color (i.e., the expected output color based on the color 646 reproduction intent defined by the Sponsor) should be calculated based on the truth of the 647 color patches.
648
649
The target slide should be scanned and displayed by the WSI system. The output color of 650 each color patch should be measured from the display.
651
652
The three datasets – truth, intended color, and output color – should be compared and 653 analyzed. The sponsor should provide a rationale if the intended color is different from 654 the truth.

Spatial Resolution 678
679
IV(B)(2)(a).
Description 680
681
Spatial resolution is another key characteristic of a WSI system.  The goal of this system-
682
level test is to evaluate the composite optical performance of all components in the image 683 acquisition phase (i.e., from slide to digital image file).
684
685
IV(B)(2)(b).
Test Methods 686
687
The following test is recommended for assessing spatial resolution of the image 688 acquisition phase: 689
- Resolution and spatial frequency response: ISO 12233:2014(E) — Photography 690
— Electronic still picture imaging — Resolution and spatial frequency responses.
691
692
IV(B)(3).
Focusing Test 693

694
- The quality of focus in WSI can be affected by a number of inter-related factors, 695 including the scanning method and approaches for constructing a focus map.  Due 696 to a trade-off between the number of focus points and the overall speed of the 697 scanning process, focusing is typically based on a sample of focus points, 698 determined automatically (auto-focus) or manually by the user.  Since tissue can 699 have uneven depth, auto-focus algorithms are needed to detect and adjust for 700 different depths of focus.
701
702
- Data demonstrating that the focus quality is acceptable, even in the presence of 703 uneven tissue, should be provided.  Such data with proper justification could be 704 derived from a phantom study, from clinical data, or both in a complementary 705 fashion.  The technology of phantom construction for testing focus is under 706 development and this guidance will be updated as such technologies become 707 available.  Sponsors could attempt to build their own phantoms for testing depth 708 Truth Meter Intended Color Output Color Accuracy Precision WSI under test Color Reproduction Intent Target Slide -



of focus for their device.  Alternatively, sponsors could provide experimental data 709 using clinical tissue slides.  Sampling of cases for such an experiment should be 710 enriched for uneven tissue cases within a range representative of typical 711 laboratory output.   Alternative approaches for assessing the focus quality of a 712 WSI will be considered along with proper justification.  In addition, the following 713 specifications should be provided, if applicable: 714 o Focus method: auto-focus for high-throughput or user-operated focus 715 points 716 o Instructions for the selection of manual focus points (if applicable), 717 including number of focus points and location in relation to a tissue 718 sample 719 o Metrics used to evaluate focusing and description of methods to extract 720 them 721 o Methods for constructing focus map from sample focus points 722

Whole Slide Tissue Coverage 734
735
IV(B)(4)(a).
Description 736
737
During the scan phase, WSI systems usually skip blank areas where tissue is absent in 738 order to reduce scan time and file size.  The purpose of the whole slide tissue coverage 739 test is to demonstrate that all of the tissue specimen on the glass slide is included in the 740 digital image file.
741
742
IV(B)(4)(b).
Test Method 743
744
Sponsors should include a test that demonstrates the completeness of the tissue coverage.
745
Sponsors should describe the test method and include the following items: 746
- Selection of the input tissue slide 747
- How to determine the complete coverage of the input tissue slide 748
- How to measure the actual coverage of the WSI output 749
- Calculate the ratio of the actual to complete coverage 750

Stitching Error 764
765
IV(B)(5)(a).
Description 766
767
Stitching is the technique that enables a WSI system to combine thousands of sub-images 768 into a single whole-slide image.  Although during the scanning process a certain amount 769 of overlapping between adjacent sub-images is maintained for alignment purposes, 770 successful stitching relies on the texture present in the overlapped area.  When the 771 stitching algorithm fails to align two sub-images seamlessly, the error may or may not be 772 perceivable by the human reader depending on whether noticeable stitching artifacts are 773 generated.  Therefore, a system-level test should be conducted when assessing the 774 stitching quality of the WSI system.
775
776
IV(B)(5)(b).
Test Methods 777
778
Sponsors should include a test that evaluates the stitching errors and include the 779 following items: 780
- Selection of the input test slide 781
- Method for sampling of the stitching boundaries where stitching errors might 782 occur 783
- How to determine the ideal stitching as the ground truth 784 o For example, the region of the stitching boundaries can be re-imaged in 785 one shot such that there is no stitching artifact.
786
- How to evaluate quality of the actual stitching based on the perfect stitching 787 o For example, compare the image of stitching boundaries with the perfect 788 one that does not have stitching artifact.  The difference between these two 789 images can be used as a figure of merit of the stitching quality.

Turnaround Time 802
803
IV(B)(6)(a).
Description 804
805
Turnaround time is the time required by the WSI system to execute a particular user 806 operation such as panning/zooming where the software and I/O (input/output) devices 807 retrieve image data, execute the computation, and refresh the image on the display. The 808 turnaround time starts when the user enters a command via a keyboard stroke or a mouse 809 click/movement and finishes when the image is completely updated on the display.
810
Turnaround time is important for a WSI system when fast and repetitive panning 811 operations are performed during a search task, which is delay-free in an optical 812 microscope.  Prolonged, unpredictable turnaround time may impact the user’s diagnostic 813 performance. The user interface should properly prompt the user when the operation is 814 incomplete and the requested image is not available . The turnaround time may vary 815 greatly depending on the user-requested operation, image content, data size/location, 816 computer workload, display size, etc. The sponsor should report the typical turnaround 817 time as well as the test method and test conditions.
818

819
IV(C). User Interface 820
821
IV(C)(1).
Description 822
823
The user interface covers all components and accessories of the WSI system with which 824 users interact while loading the slides and acquiring, manipulating, and reviewing the 825 images.  It also includes preparing the system for use (e.g., unpacking, set up, 826 calibration), and performing maintenance.  Elements of the user interface have been 827 noted in many of the preceding sections and include two broad categories: 828
- Options through which the user operates the WSI system, such as: 829 o Software menu options (e.g., scanning parameters)
830
o Physical controls (e.g., clips on the slide feeder)
831
o Connectors and connections (e.g., cables connecting system components)
832
- Information presented to the user through 833
o Visual displays (e.g., scanned image, software menus)
834
o Sounds (e.g., tone played when scanning completed)
835
o Instructions (e.g., software users’ manual)
836
o Labels 837
838
IV(C)(2).
Test Methods 839
840
It is recommended that the analysis to identify the use-related hazards of the WSI system 841 include the consideration of use errors involving failure to acquire, perceive, read, 842 interpret, and act on information from the WSI system correctly or at all and the harm 843 that could be caused by such errors.  A human factors/usability validation test should be 844 performed to demonstrate that representative users of the WSI system can perform 845 essential tasks and those critical to safety under simulated use conditions.
846



20

847
When selecting participants for validation testing, sponsors should carefully consider user 848 capabilities and expectations that could potentially impact the safe and effective use of 849 the WSI system.  Examples of items that should be considered, if applicable, include 850 visual acuity and type of vision correction and the impact of expectations formed from 851 prior experience with other systems (e.g., optical microscope).
852
853
When selecting the critical tasks to be evaluated, sponsors should incorporate all known 854 use related errors and problems from similar devices (devices having similar 855 technological characteristics and indications for use) into the validation testing.
856
Consideration also should be given to whether task performance changes over time, and 857 if test duration needs to account for user fatigue.  Examples might include a user altering 858 a task sequence in response to fatigue from repetitive image selection and manipulation 859 with mouse or keyboard.
860
861
When creating the simulated use conditions for validation testing, special consideration 862 should be given to the location of the WSI system primary workstation, its components, 863 their arrangement and how their locations affect user performance.  Examples of location 864 considerations might include multiple monitors, a monitor with sub-optimal display 865 settings, or glare on a monitor from indoor lighting.
866
867
A human factors/usability validation test report should generally include the information 868 found in Table 1.

873
Recommended methods for performing a human factors/usability validation test are 874 described in the resources listed in section IV(C)(3) entitled “Resources” directly below.
875
The goal of testing is to assure that users can operate the WSI system successfully for the 876 intended uses without negative clinical consequences to the patient and that potential use 877 errors or failures have been eliminated or reduced.

In addition, FDA has published guidance with human factors related recommendations to 897 assist manufacturers and facilitate premarket review.  The guidance entitled “Guidance 898 for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices”
899
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocument 900 s/ucm089543.htm).  This guidance document provides recommendations to industry 901 regarding premarket submissions for software devices, including stand-alone software 902 applications and hardware-based devices that incorporate software.  It includes test 903 methods to assure that the software conforms to the needs of the user and to check for 904 proper operation of the software in its actual or simulated use environment.
905
906
IV(D). Labeling 907
908
The premarket application must include labeling in sufficient detail to satisfy the 909 requirements of 21 CFR Part 801 and 21 CFR 809.10.  The labeling includes 910 supplementary information necessary to use and care for the WSI system such as 911 instruction books or direction sheets and software user manuals.
912
913



Although instructions, labeling, and training can influence users to use devices safely and 914 effectively, they should not be the primary strategy used to control risk.  Modification of 915 the user interface design is a more effective approach to mitigate use-related hazards.
916
917
IV(D)(1).
Test Methods 918
919
It is recommended that studies on labeling and training be conducted separately from 920 other human factors/usability validation testing.  Human factors/usability validation 921 testing should be conducted with the final version of the labeling and related materials.
922
Timing and content of training should be consistent with that expected of actual users.
