## Overview

Step 7 performs full-text quality appraisal of literature screened as "Relevant" in Step 4, using systematic scoring based on IMDRF clinical evaluation guidance and MDCG evidence grading criteria.

## Scoring System

### Four-dimension Quality Scoring

Each article is scored across four dimensions, 1-3 points each:

| Dimension | Description | Score |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Design (D) | Study design quality | 1-3 |
| Applicability (A) | Applicability to target device | 1-3 |
| Population (P) | Study population relevance | 1-3 |
| Reporting (R) | Completeness of result reporting | 1-3 |
| **Total (SUM)** | **Composite score** | **4-12** |

### SOTA Assessment

In addition to the four-dimension scoring, each article undergoes a State of the Art (SOTA) assessment to determine whether the literature reflects current best practices and clinical standards.

### Contribution Assessment

Evaluates each article's contribution to clinical evaluation conclusions:
- Contribution to safety argumentation
- Contribution to effectiveness argumentation
- Contribution to benefit-risk evaluation

## Ethical Contraindications (Optional)

Same as Step 4 -- if the target indication has ethical constraints preventing RCTs, enable "Ethical Contraindications". When enabled, scoring adjusts requirements for study design level and does not penalize articles for lacking RCT evidence.

## Batch Processing

Step 7 also uses batch processing:
- Each batch appraises a group of articles
- Auto-continue mode runs sequentially
- Can pause for manual batch review
- All batch results merge on completion

## Output

Each article's appraisal includes:
- Four-dimension scores (D/A/P/R) and composite score
- SOTA assessment conclusion
- Contribution evaluation
- Key findings summary
- Methodological limitations

## Split PDFs with ArticleFetcher Organize {#af-organize}

After appraisal, **Export list** writes a CSV that ArticleFetcher **Organize** uses to copy (or move) PDFs into included and excluded folders.

**Use v0.5.1 or later.** Download from the links below, from [Step 4](./eu-step4.html#af-fetch), or from the assistant Step 4 toolbar; or use a latest copy you already downloaded. Older builds have no Organize tab and cannot honour `DuplicateOf` for extra PDFs that share a DOI.

**Download ArticleFetcher v0.5.1:**

- Windows: [China](https://app.reguverse.com/downloads/ArticleFetcher-Windows.zip) · [International](https://app.team-ra.org/downloads/ArticleFetcher-Windows.zip)
- macOS: [China](https://app.reguverse.com/downloads/ArticleFetcher-macOS-GUI.zip) · [International](https://app.team-ra.org/downloads/ArticleFetcher-macOS-GUI.zip)

1. On the Step 7 summary, click **Export list** to get `step7_disposition_DATE.csv`.
2. Open ArticleFetcher and switch to the **Organize** tab.
3. **PDF folder**: the folder where Fetch saved the PDFs.
4. **Disposition CSV**: the list you just exported.
5. Default is **copy** (originals stay put). Check **Move files instead of copy** only if you want files relocated.
6. Click **Organize Files**. Then check:
   - `Included/` — included full texts
   - `Excluded/` — excluded full texts
   - `Unmatched/` — rows that did not match a file, plus `organize_report.csv`

Match order: exact filename → screening number (`N.` or `N_`) → DOI via `download_report.csv` if those miss. Extra copies of the same DOI keep their own file. Matching never uses last name + year.
