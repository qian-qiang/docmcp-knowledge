# Create EU MDR Project

::: info
The full narrative for this page — six evaluation pathways, Device Description as source of truth, and the rule that context files feed steps rather than CEP/CER generation — is currently maintained in the [Chinese create-project guide](/zh/guide/eu-create-project). Read the [Chinese clinical evaluation overview](/zh/guide/eu-ce-overview) first. English translation will follow after that text is confirmed.

## Overview

Create a project to start the EU MDR clinical evaluation workflow. After creation, the system guides you through 10 steps to generate CEP, CER, and DCR documents.

## Steps

1. Click "Projects" in bottom navigation
2. Click "+ New Project"
3. Fill in project information:
   - Project name
   - Regulatory framework: EU MDR
   - Device name, classification (I/IIa/IIb/III)
   - Manufacturer name
   - Product description
4. Click "Create"

## Project Dashboard

After creation, the dashboard shows:
- Project information
- Task list (add multiple workflow tasks)
- Document pipeline

## Prerequisite: Device Description

::: warning Important Pre-step
Before starting the clinical evaluation workflow, it is recommended to complete the Device Description first. Structured information from the Device Description is automatically injected into multiple CEP/CER document sections (features, principles of operation, intended purpose, etc.), ensuring accuracy and consistency.
:::

The Device Description module allows you to fill in structured device information:

- **Features & Functions** -- Technical features and core capabilities
- **Configurations & Variants** -- Different models and options
- **Accessories** -- Accompanying accessories and components
- **Previous Generations / Similar Devices** -- Prior versions and market equivalents
- **Principles of Operation** -- Technical working principles

**How to fill:**
- Manually fill each field
- Click "AI Fill" to automatically extract device information from uploaded context files

<!-- Screenshot placeholder: Device Description module -->

## Context Files

Upload reference documents for AI to use:
- IFU / Technical specifications
- Design documents
- Existing clinical data
- Equivalent device information
- PDF / Word / Excel supported

::: tip
Upload detailed device information documents. AI will extract key information for analysis in subsequent steps.
